# Creating a simple webshop

## Data Management

For this project we had the options of either implementing our own data management system (using csv files or similar) or to use a database using mysql. We decided to connect to a mysql database.

- [mysqli_connect()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mysqli-connect.php): opens a new connection to the MySQL server
- [mysqli_query()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/mysqli.query.php): performs a query on the database you are connected to

According to the subject we are not allowed to use OOP so we need to use the mysqli __procedural mode__!

## User Management

We learned user management in PHP in day04 of the Piscine. You can find my notes from that [here](https://github.com/bbehm/Piscine_PHP/blob/main/day04/notes.md).
