# A Simple Webshop

A simple webshop in PHP created in two days as part of the PHP Piscine at Hive Helsinki. My notes and theory stuff can be found in [notes.md](notes.md).

### What does it include?

- __Data Management__: connecting to a MySQL database
- __User Management__: create, modify, and delete user accounts
- __Shopping cart__: list of products the user wants to buy + prices, quantities, total cost
- __Categories and associated products__: organizing products by category, a product can belong to multiple categories
- __Landing page__: simple and attractive
- __Admin section__: users with enough privilege can manage content of website from here (add, modify and remove items, organize categories, manage users etc). The admin section must include validated orders.
