# A Simple Webshop

A simple webshop in PHP created in two days as part of the PHP Piscine at Hive Helsinki. My notes and theory stuff can be found in [notes.md](notes.md).

### What does it include?

- __Data Management__: connecting to a MySQL database for data handling
- __User Management__: you are able to create, modify, and delete user accounts
- __Shopping cart__: a user can add and delete things from the basket, things that are added before login will stay in basket when logged in (to place an order the user must create an account and be logged in)
- __Categories and associated products__: products on the shop are organized by category, a product can belong to multiple categories
- __Landing page__: simple and attractive
- __Admin section__: admin users can see all existing users and modify them as well as give users admin rights
